\section*{\centering \Large \_ \_ \_ About The Project \_ \_ \_}

This project is a hands-on implementation of a \textbf{Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)} built with \textbf{Keras} and \textbf{TensorFlow}. The goal is to train a generator model to create realistic 32x32 pixel color images that are indistinguishable from the real images in the \textbf{CIFAR-10 dataset}.

The notebook covers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Building a \textbf{Discriminator} model to classify images as real or fake.
    \item Building a \textbf{Generator} model to create new images from a latent noise vector.
    \item Combining these two models into a single GAN.
    \item The complete training loop to teach the models adversarially.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\centering \Large \_ \_ \_ Model Architecture \_ \_ \_}

The GAN consists of two main components: a Generator and a Discriminator.

\begin{description}
    \item[\textbf{The Discriminator}] is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to take an image as input and predict the probability that the image is real (from the dataset) versus fake (created by the generator). It uses \texttt{Conv2D} layers with \texttt{LeakyReLU} activation.

    \item[\textbf{The Generator}] takes a 100-dimensional vector of random noise as input and attempts to create a realistic 32x32x3 image. It uses \texttt{Conv2DTranspose} layers to upsample the noise vector into a full image.
\end{description}

\section*{\centering \Large \_ \_ \_ Training \_ \_ \_}

The model is trained for \textbf{100 epochs} with a \textbf{batch size of 128}. During training, the generator and discriminator are trained in opposition: the generator tries to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to get better at catching the fakes. The generator's progress and model weights are saved every 10 epochs.

\section*{\centering \Large \_ \_ \_ Further Improvements \_ \_ \_}

While this project provides a solid foundation, here are some ways it could be improved:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Implement a WGAN:} Use a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) for more stable training and to avoid mode collapse.
    \item \textbf{Hyperparameter Tuning:} Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizer settings.
    \item \textbf{Architectural Changes:} Try deeper networks or different activation functions.
    \item \textbf{Higher Resolution:} Modify the generator to produce higher-resolution images.
\end{itemize}
