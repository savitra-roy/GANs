💻 Tech Stack
📖 About The Project
This project is a hands-on implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) built with Keras and TensorFlow. The goal is to train a generator model to create realistic 32x32 pixel color images that are indistinguishable from the real images in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The notebook covers:

Building a Discriminator model to classify images as real or fake.

Building a Generator model to create new images from a latent noise vector.

Combining these two models into a single GAN.

The complete training loop to teach the models adversarially.

🏗️ Model Architecture
The GAN consists of two main components: a Generator and a Discriminator.

The Discriminator is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to take an image as input and predict the probability that the image is real (from the dataset) versus fake (created by the generator). It uses Conv2D layers with LeakyReLU activation.

The Generator takes a 100-dimensional vector of random noise as input and attempts to create a realistic 32x32x3 image. It uses Conv2DTranspose layers to upsample the noise vector into a full image.

💡 Training
The model is trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 128. During training, the generator and discriminator are trained in opposition: the generator tries to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to get better at catching the fakes. The generator's progress and model weights are saved every 10 epochs.

🌟 Further Improvements
While this project provides a solid foundation, here are some ways it could be improved:

Implement a WGAN: Use a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) for more stable training and to avoid mode collapse.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizer settings.

Architectural Changes: Try deeper networks or different activation functions.

Higher Resolution: Modify the generator to produce higher-resolution images.
